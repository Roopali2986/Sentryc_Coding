Test Case "view terms and condition"
Initially I was able to click on the visual search button and enter the Bing search engine.
Actually the visual search button was hidden, it used to appear only when the mouse pointer hover over it.
After entering the visual search, at one corner of the page the "terms and condition" link was available to click.
Later the this visual search was not available to test or work on it. Due to which I was not successful with testing this functionality.
